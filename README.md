# IMDB Data Analysis - Learnings

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of IMDB movie data. During the process, I learned and applied various data analysis, visualization, and Python programming techniques. Below are the key skills and concepts I explored while working on this project.
## Key Learnings:

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Data**: I learned how to identify and handle missing or null values in datasets using `pandas`.
   - **Data Transformation**: I transformed raw data into a more useful format, such as converting revenue columns to numeric values for analysis.
   - **Data Type Conversion**: I worked on converting data types, for example, converting string values to float for proper analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Understanding Data Distribution**: I used various statistical methods to understand the distribution of movie ratings, revenues, and genres.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Learned how to identify and handle outliers in the dataset that could affect the overall analysis.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: I explored correlations between variables, such as ratings and revenue, to see how one variable affects another.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: I created different types of visualizations like bar charts, line plots, and histograms to explore data trends.
   - **Scatter Plots**: Learned how to visualize relationships between two continuous variables (e.g., movie revenue vs. rating).
   - **Heatmaps**: Used heatmaps to visualize correlation matrices and understand relationships between multiple variables.

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - **Mean, Median, Mode**: I explored central tendency measures to better understand the average movie ratings, revenues, etc.
   - **Variance and Standard Deviation**: I learned how to calculate and interpret variance and standard deviation to measure data dispersion.
   - **Skewness**: I investigated how data skewness can affect analysis and the interpretation of results.

### 5. **Python Programming**
   - **Pandas**: I worked with `pandas` for data manipulation, including filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.
   - **NumPy**: Used `NumPy` for performing numerical operations and calculations.
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Learned how to use these libraries to create various static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### 6. **Project Management with Git & GitHub**
   - **Version Control**: I used `Git` for version control, including creating commits, pushing to GitHub, and managing branches.
   - **Collaborative Workflow**: Through the GitHub platform, I learned how to collaborate and track changes in a project repository.
   - **Repository Setup**: I gained experience setting up a GitHub repository, adding files, and managing the repository with `git push` and `git pull`.
